Source code is under UltimateBot/srs/Main
Main.java is the main script that handles the other scripts. Each other script will have its own folder underneath that (ex. "Combat").

If you look at the code for the main script, you can see how I hooked the combat script in there (I'm about to add comments). I'll take care of updating the main class, it's just benefitial to see how it actually runs.
